This is a well-known attack vector for contracts that utilize pricePerShare for accounting.

[Vault.sol#L147](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L147)

```solidity
        shares = convertToShares(assets) - feeShares;
    }
```


[Vault.sol#L293-L300](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-popcorn/blob/main/src/vault/Vault.sol#L293-L300)

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Amount of shares the vault would exchange for given amount of assets, in an ideal scenario.
     * @param assets Exact amount of assets
     * @return Exact amount of shares
     */
    function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply(); // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

        return
            supply == 0
                ? assets
                : assets.mulDiv(supply, totalAssets(), Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
```
	
	
	
A malicious early user can call deposit() with 1 wei  as the first depositor of the Vault.sol contract and get 1 wei of shares token.

Then the attacker can send for example (100e18 - 1)  directly to the contract without using the deposit function, and inflate the price per share from 1 to an extreme value of 100e18.

if a future user will deposit (100e18-1) token he will not receive any shares due to rounding calculation. He will immediately lose his deposit value.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send a fixed value of the initial mints as a reserve to the DAO address so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.
